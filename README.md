# 🚨 Problem to solve

There is a widespread problem within companies dedicated to trade with any kind of products, companies that typically act as intermediaries between suppliers and the end customer. 

The core of the business is focused on profiting from these transactions, constantly searching through different suppliers or competitors for different offers, buying when they believe they can sell at a price high enough to make a profit.

The problem arises from the **complexity of analyzing** every supplier or store that offers each product, making it tedious (and almost impossible) to cover all possible purchasing options for a given product. 

# ✅ Solution

Create an AI-based solution that addresses this issue. In a simple, effective, and natural way, this tool allows users to search for information on any product online, simplifying this task to an extreme degree.

- Each query automatically returns the best offer for each product, as well as relevant information such as delivery time, supplier, and product status. It also allows filtering by product status.

- It will also provide the user with information on the current price, indicating the price trend, its position relative to historical data, and even the highest and lowest prices reached by that supplier for that product.

- After obtaining this information, the user will also be given the option to quickly purchase the product, specifying the desired condition and quantity. By doing this, the user will be obtain all necessary information to make a purchase.

With this workflow, **a complete comparison of suppliers, prices, and market flows can be performed for a single product, and a purchase order can be placed with the desired conditions, all in a matter of seconds.**
