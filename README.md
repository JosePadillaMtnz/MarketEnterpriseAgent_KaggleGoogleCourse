# MarketEnterpriseAgent_KaggleGoogleCourse

Throughout this repository's notebook you will find my Capstone Project related to the Google+ Kaggle 5-day Agents course. 

As I said inside the notebook, I'm trying to solve a widespread problem within companies dedicated to trade with any kind of products, companies that typically act as intermediaries between suppliers and the end customer. The core of the business is focused on profiting from these transactions, constantly searching through different suppliers or competitors for different offers, buying when they believe they can sell at a price high enough to make a profit.

The problem arises from the **complexity of analyzing** each and every supplier or store that offers each product, making it tedious (and almost impossible) to cover all possible purchasing options for a given product. To solve this, you will see my AI-based solution to improve the efficiency of looking over internet for a product, retrieve information or manage product purchase. Main improvements compared with the traditional way:

- Each query automatically returns the best offer for each product, as well as relevant information such as delivery time, supplier, and product status. It also allows filtering by product status.
- It will also provide the user with information on the current price, indicating the price trend, its position relative to historical data, and even the highest and lowest prices reached by that supplier for that product.
- After obtaining this information, the user will also be given the option to quickly purchase the product, specifying the desired condition and quantity. By doing this, the user will be obtain all necessary information to make a purchase.

With the workflow of the notebook, **a complete comparison of suppliers, prices, and market flows can be performed for a single product, and a purchase order can be placed with the desired conditions, all in a matter of seconds.**
